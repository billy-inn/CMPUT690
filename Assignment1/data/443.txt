Javier "Javi" Márquez Moreno (Spanish pronunciation: [xaˈβjer ˈmarkeθ]; born 11 May 1986 in Barcelona, Catalonia) is a Spanish footballer who plays for RCD Espanyol as a defensive midfielder.
A product of hometown RCD Espanyol's youth system, Márquez was promoted to the first team for the 2009–10 season, making his top level debut on September 19 - playing 30 minutes at Deportivo de La Coruña for a 3–2 win, having replaced Israeli Ben Sahar. He quickly established himself in the first team, and on 20 December 2009, he scored his first goal in a 2–0 home win against UD Almería. However, his season ended prematurely in March 2010, after he broke his leg in a match against Sevilla FC.
Márquez recovered fully for 2010–11, being an undisputed starter for the Mauricio Pochettino-led side, partnering another Espanyol youth graduate, Raúl Baena, in central midfield.
