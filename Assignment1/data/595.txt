Alessandro Carrozza (born 1 February 1982 in Gallipoli, Apulia) is an Italian footballer currently playing for Atalanta in Italy's Serie A.
Carrozza's footballing career began later on than usual. He had aspirations of becoming a footballer when he was 18 years old, but instead he became a carpenter. When watching a Serie C game on television one day, he didn't think his abilities were any inferior to what he was watching. He joined his local team; the now defunct Gallipoli Calcio, playing in Italian football's eighth tier, working his way up through the leagues with various clubs. His dream of becoming a Serie A player came true in January 2012 when he joined Atalanta on loan, aged 30.
