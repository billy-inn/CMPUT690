The Stadio San Nicola is a multi-use all-seater stadium designed by Renzo Piano in Bari, Italy. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Associazione Sportiva Bari. It hosted the 1991 European Cup Final, won by Red Star Belgrade. The stadium itself resembles a 'flower'. To create this particular design, the stadium consists of 26 'petals' and upper tiers of the higher ring which are separated by 8-metre empty spaces, sufficient to guarantee satisfactory security conditions.
The stadium holds 58,248 people, but has never been filled to capacity for a match; the attendance at the 1991 European Cup final was roughly 51,000.
The stadium was built in 1990 for the 1990 World Cup, during which it hosted five matches: Soviet Union vs. Romania, Cameroon vs. Romania, and Cameroon vs. Soviet Union in group B action; in the round of 16 matches, Czechoslovakia vs. Costa Rica; and the third place match between Italy and England.
The stadium hosted the European Championship Qualifier between Italy and Scotland in March 2007, which Italy won 2â€“0, and was also a deciding match for the Unofficial World Football Championships.
