Juan Carlos Paredes Reasco (born July 8, 1987 in Esmeraldas) is an Ecuadorian footballer currently playing for Deportivo Quito.
Paredes is a skillfull player who started playing professionally for Deportivo Cuenca. He was sought by Barcelona a year later and he signed a contract with them. He then moved on to Rocafuerte FC of Ecuador's third division. He helped the team get promoted to the second division for the 2008-2009 season. He then came back to where he started as the new reinforcement for Cuenca's copa libertadores campaign.
Paredes was summoned to defend the national football team, on friendly games against, Mexico and Venezuela. Which was seen as an overdue merit, by followers of his previous club Cuenca.
