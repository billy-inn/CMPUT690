Atleti Azzurri d'Italia is a stadium in Bergamo, Italy, used by the Atalanta and Albinoleffe football teams. The field is 120 m long, and 70 m wide. The stadium has officially 24,642 recognized seats.
The stadium is seen by many to be outdated and not up to standard for Serie A due to poor facilities, poor views from a number of stands and because most of the stadium has no roof cover.
In the last decade some projects for a new stadium have been proposed but as of February 2010 no project has been carried out.
