Aleix Vidal Parreu (born 21 August 1989 in Valls, Tarragona, Catalonia) is a Spanish footballer who plays for UD Almería as a forward.
In 2008, Vidal signed for RCD Espanyol, but never appeared for its first team, finishing his only season with the club on loan, with Greek outfit Panthrakikos FC.
On 31 August 2009, he signed for second division club Gimnàstic de Tarragona, but spent the vast majority of the season with Pobla de Mafumet CF, the farm team.
Vidal joined RCD Mallorca in the 2010 summer, being assigned to the Balearic Islands team's reserves in the third level. In mid-June 2011, after his team's relegation, he joined another team in the category, UD Almería B.
Vidal made his debut for the Andalusians' first team on 27 August 2011, against Córdoba CF. Shortly after, he was promoted to the main squad and received the #8 jersey, following the departure of Albert Crusat to Wigan Athletic.
