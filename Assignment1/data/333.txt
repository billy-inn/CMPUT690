Tiago Abiola Delfim Almeida Ilori (born 26 February 1993) is a Portuguese footballer who plays for Sporting Clube de Portugal as a central defender.
Born in London, England, Ilori joined Sporting Clube de Portugal's youth ranks in the 2006 summer, signing from Imortal Desportivo Clube. For 2007–08, the 14-year old was loaned to Lisbon neighbours G.D. Estoril Praia, returning for three more seasons.
On 6 November 2011, Ilori made his official debut for the Lions' first team, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–1 league home win against U.D.

Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico, as his team had already secured the first place in its group.
