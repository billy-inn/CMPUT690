Nicola Pozzi (born 30 June 1986) is an Italian footballer who currently plays in the Serie B league for Sampdoria. He was born in Santarcangelo di Romagna.
Signed by AC Milan from then-Serie C1 side Cesena on January 2004, he was successively loaned to Napoli and Pescara, before being sent on loan to Empoli F.C. for two consecutive seasons (2005–06 and 2006–07).
In 2007–08 season, his status was changed to co-owned by both sides, for €750,000 (that season Empoli also signed Luca Antonini (€1M), Lino Marzoratti (€0.75M) and Ignazio Abate (€0.9M) in co-ownership deals), and in 16 June 2008 Empoli got full ownership for €3.25 million (Pozzi) and €1.5 million (Marzoratti ) in exchange of Antonini (€2.9 million) and Abate (€2million) who return to AC Milan.
On December 9, 2007, he scored all four goals in Empoli's 4–1 victory over Cagliari. However, he suffered a season-ending knee injury after netting a brace in a 3–1 defeat of Napoli on February 17, and will be sidelined for six months, effectively ruling him out of the Azzurrini squad for the 2008 Olympics.
Pozzi also represented Italy at the Under-21 level.
