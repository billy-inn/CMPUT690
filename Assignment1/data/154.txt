Alexandre Coeff (born 20 February 1992 in Brest) is a French football player who currently plays for RC Lens. He is a France youth international having earned caps at all levels for which he is currently eligible. Coeff plays as a central midfielder. On 10 October 2008, at the age of 16, he signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Lens. A rupture of both the medial collateral ligament and anterior cruciate ligament in one of his knees delayed his professional career and, after successfully undergoing rehabilitation, Coeff spent two years playing on the club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth division of French football. On 29 May 2011, Coeff made his professional debut appearing as a substitute in a 4â€“0 away defeat to Nancy.
