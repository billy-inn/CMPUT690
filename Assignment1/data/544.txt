Marco Motta (born 14 May 1986) is an Italian footballer who plays as a defender for Serie A club Calcio Catania, on loan from Juventus.
Motta is a former youth international and participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics.
Born in Merate, Lombardy, Motta began his professional career with Lombardy side Atalanta B.C. in 2005, following his promotion from the club's youth setup. He was a member of the 2004–05 Primavera Under-20 squad, and made his Serie A debut on 9 January 2005, replacing Riccardo Montolivo in the 65th minute. On 13 January he was a starter in the Cup, ahead Damiano Zenoni, a match in which Juventus was eliminated in a 5–3 aggregate. Motta made 22 appearances (3 in Cup) in the remainder of the season to replace the left of Zenoni who left on 1 February, but due to the club's relegation, he moved to Udinese Calcio in a co-ownership deal, prior to the start of the 2005–06 Serie A season. Udinese also signed several players from Bergamo, namely Cesare Natali and young players Massimo Gotti, Piermario Morosini, Fausto Rossini, and Michele Rinaldi; it sent Thomas Manfredini and Antonino D'Agostino to Bergamo as part of the deal.
