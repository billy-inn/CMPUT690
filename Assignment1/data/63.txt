Málaga Club de Fútbol is a Spanish football club based in Málaga, Andalusia. The team currently plays in Spain's La Liga.
Málaga CF is generally seen as the successor to CD Málaga, one of the most historical Andalusian football clubs, by being a near-identical looking football club that even shares the same fan base and traditions, although in legal terms it's a different entity with a separate register and another founding date, that of its former reserve team, Atlético Malagueño. As such, after the 20 seasons in La Liga, 29 in Segunda División, and nine in Tercera División played by the now defunct CD Málaga, the current Málaga CF has played nine seasons in La Liga three in Segunda División, three in Segunda División B and one in Tercera División. They also won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2002 and qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup, reaching the quarter-final stages.
In 2006 Lorenzo Sanz, a former Real Madrid president, purchased a 97% holding in the club and then appointed his son Fernando Sanz, the former captain of the team, as club president. The club was again sold in June 2010, as Qatari investor, Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani, bought the club
