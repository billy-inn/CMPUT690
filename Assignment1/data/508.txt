Antonio Amaya Carazo (born 31 May 1983) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Real Betis as a central defender.
Born in the Spanish capital of Madrid, Amaya began his football career at local San Cristóbal de los Ángeles. He joined another team in the community, Rayo Vallecano, in 2002, also serving a six-month loan spell at lowly UD San Sebastián de los Reyes, in Segunda División B.
Eventually, Amaya returned to Rayo, becoming an important defensive unit for the side, which returned to Segunda División in 2007–08, and comfortably maintained its league status, with the player appearing in less than half of the games (18 out of 42).
Amaya signed for Premier League team Wigan Athletic on a three-year contract, on 14 August 2009, being joined at the club by Rayo teammate Mohamed Diamé a week later. He made his debut in a 1–4 defeat at Blackpool in the League Cup on the 26th, scoring Wigan's goal with a header in stoppage time.
After failing to make a single league appearance in the 2009–10 season, Amaya returned to former club Rayo, in a season-long loan. He was regularly used as the club returned to La Liga after an eight-year absence.
On 18 July 2011, Wigan announced the departure
