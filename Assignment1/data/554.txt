Pablo Daniel Osvaldo (born 12 January 1986) is an Argentine-born Italian footballer, who plays as a striker for Serie A club for Roma.
Osvaldo made his competitive football debut in the Argentine 2nd Division for Club Atlético Huracán in 2005. After less than a year he was signed by Italian side Atalanta, where he played only three matches with a single goal in the Serie B 2005–06. In 2006 Atalanta agreed to a co-ownership deal which sent the player to Lecce, another Serie B team, where Osvaldo had the opportunity to play regularly, scoring eight goals in 31 appearances with the giallorossi. Following such a fairly impressive season, Atalanta regained the full player's property and sold him to Fiorentina for €4.6 million. He played his first Serie A match on September 29, 2007, scoring two goals in a 3–0 away win to Livorno.
On March 2, 2008 he headed in a cross from team mate Papa Waigo to give Fiorentina a 3–2 win in stoppage time over their fiercest rivals, Juventus. He was then sent off for his goal celebration, after having been booked earlier in the match, when he removed his team jersey and pretended to machine gun his own fans in a similar fashion to Fiorentina legend
