Hélder Manuel Marques Postiga (born 2 August 1982) is a Portuguese footballer who plays for Real Zaragoza in Spain, as a striker.
After starting professionally at Porto, Postiga went on to have spells in England (one season with Tottenham), France and Greece (five months apiece), before returning to his country with Sporting.
A Portuguese international on more than 50 occasions, Postiga has represented the country in one World Cup and three European Championships, helping the national team reach the final at Euro 2004.
Born in Vila do Conde, Postiga started his career at northern side Varzim SC. In 1998, at 16, he joined F.C. Porto's youth teams, and continued to progress until he reached the reserve squad. At the time, coach Octávio Machado picked him for the first team on some occasions and Postiga performed well.
After José Mourinho assumed command of the team, Postiga exploded. He scored 13 goals in 2002–03 (before his 21st birthday) and soon became a star in Porto's frontline, alongside Derlei. Postiga had also earned a permanent selection for the Portuguese under-21 team by this time.
After winning the 2003 Primeira Liga, Postiga moved to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur
