Antonio Rodríguez Martínez, aka Toño (born 17 December 1979 in Alicante, Valencian Community), is a Spanish footballer who plays for Racing de Santander as a goalkeeper.
After making his professional debuts with hometown Hércules CF, Toño joined Recreativo de Huelva (second division) in 2003–04. In January 2005, he was signed by La Liga side Racing de Santander but, in the same month the following year, returned to Huelva, on loan. During both his spells in Andalusia, he had an interesting battle for first-choice status with José Antonio Luque.
In the following seasons, Toño was the undisputed first-choice. In 2007–08, as Racing achieved a first ever UEFA Cup qualification, he finished second to Iker Casillas in the Ricardo Zamora Trophy race, an award which he had already won in his debut season with Recre.
Toño started the 2009–10 season as starter. However, on 28 February 2010, he suffered a leg injury as the Cantabrians lost 0–2 at home to UD Almería, and would miss more than two months of action, although he would be reinstated for the final two games, as Racing narrowly avoided relegation (including the decisive 2–0 home triumph against Sporting de Gijón).
