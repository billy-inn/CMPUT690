Mattia Valoti (born 6 September 1993) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Serie A club Milan.
Valoti was born in Vicenza on 6 September 1993, the son of former footballer Aladino Valoti, who played for several Serie A and Serie B teams during the late 1980s and 1990s and is currently the director of football at Albinoleffe. Mattia started playing football at the age of 5 in the youth team of Lucchese, the club where his father was playing at the time. Over the next eight years, Mattia played for several clubs, namely Cosenza, Palermo, Crotone, Martina Franca and Dalmine Futura, as a result of his father's transfers.
In 2006, Valoti settled at Albinoleffe, spending five seasons in the club's youth system. There, he went on to make his professional debut, aged 17, coming on as a substitute in a Coppa Italia game against Crotone, on 27 October 2010. Three days later, he also made his Serie B debut, again coming off the bench in a match against Novara. During the January 2011 transfer window, Serie A club Milan signed Valoti to a co-ownership deal, though allowing him to stay at Albinoleffe for the remainder of the season.
