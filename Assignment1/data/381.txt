Amauri Carvalho de Oliveira (born 3 June 1980), better known as Amauri, is a footballer who plays as a striker for Serie A club Fiorentina. His previous clubs include Bellinzona, Parma, Napoli, Piacenza, Empoli, Messina, Chievo, Palermo and Juventus. Born in Carapicuíba, a city in Brazil, he represented Italy at international level after acquiring Italian citizenship.
Amauri was trialed at Palmeiras, the club of his place of birth, São Paulo state, but failed to impress. At the age of 19, he went to Santa Catarina state to work and played for a local club at Santa Catarina State League 2nd Division. Santa Catarina Clube was invited to Torneo di Viareggio in Italy, at which he showed his talent to scouts; he was signed by a club from the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland, AC Bellinzona. He scored once in 5 appearances.
After half-season in the Swiss Nationalliga B and Nationalliga A/B playoffs, he played for Napoli in 2000–01, due to the abolish of non-EU quota in the mid season. Amauri until 2010 heard he was actually signed by Parma and on loan to Napoli, instead of signed by Napoli directly at the hearing of Caso Parmalat.
Amauri made his Italian Serie A debut on 14 April
