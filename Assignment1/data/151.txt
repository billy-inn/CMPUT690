Luís Carlos Pereira Carneiro (born 8 September 1988 in Lamelas, Castro Daire Municipality), aka Licá, is a Portuguese footballer who plays for G.D. Estoril Praia as a forward.
Licá joined Académica de Coimbra from the lower leagues in 2007, aged 19. He appeared rarely for the team over the course of two top division seasons, also being loaned to another modest side, G.D. Tourizense, during his contract; on 22 February 2009, he scored his first goal in the main division, helping to a 3–1 home win against C.S. Marítimo.
In the 2010 January transfer window, Licá signed for C.D. Trofense in the second level, on loan, scoring five goals in 27 games in his first full season, as the Trofa club narrowly missed on promotion.
