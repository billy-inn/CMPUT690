Pedro Filipe Teodósio Mendes (born 1 October 1990 in Neuchâtel, Switzerland) is a Portuguese footballer who plays for Real Madrid Castilla on loan from Sporting Clube de Portugal, as a central defender.
Mendes reached Sporting Clube de Portugal's youth system in 2003, aged 12. In his first two senior seasons, he played with Real Sport Clube (third division) and Servette FC (Switzerland, second level), in both cases on loan, helping the latter club to promotion.
In the 2011 summer, still owned by Sporting, Mendes joined Real Madrid, being assigned to the B team. On 7 December 2011, he made his first-team debut, replacing Álvaro Arbeloa midway through the second half of a 3–0 away win against AFC Ajax for the season's UEFA Champions League.
