Patrice Latyr Evra (French pronunciation: [pa.tʁis e.vʁa]; born 15 May 1981) is a French international footballer who plays for English club Manchester United in the Premier League and the France national team. Originally an attacker, he primarily plays as a left back and is described as "the classic example of a modern full-back" who is renowned for his "pace, athleticism, and determination". Evra "offers a genuine attacking outlet down the left" and is also "strong in the air" despite his noticeably small frame. Evra, whom Sir Alex Ferguson praised for his leadership, has served as captain for both Manchester United and France.
The son of a diplomat, Evra was born in Senegal and arrived in Europe when he was a year old. He was raised in France and began his football career playing for various clubs in the Île-de-France region such as hometown club CO Les Ulis and CSF Brétigny. In 1997, he had a stint at professional club Paris Saint-Germain. A year later, Evra seized his first footballing opportunity in neighboring Italy when he signed his first professional contract with Marsala in Sicily. He made his professional debut with the club and, in the ensuing season, joined Monza.
