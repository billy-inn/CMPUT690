Felipe Salvador Caicedo Corozo (born 5 September 1988 in Guayaquil) is an Ecuadorian association footballer who plays as a striker for Lokomotiv Moscow.
Caicedo was signed by Swiss Super League side FC Basel from Rocafuerte in his native Ecuador during the Swiss 2005–06 season for an undisclosed fee while he was just 17 years old. Due to his youth, he was trained in the minor divisions. He went on to play 20 games for Basel in the following 2006–07 season, accompanied by three Swiss League goals. Clubs from La Liga, Premier League, and Serie A were monitoring his progress, with Milan said to have made an inquiry in the winter of 2007.
On 31 January 2008, it was announced that Manchester City had secured Caicedo's services on a four-and-a-half year deal through a £5.2 million transfer fee (€7 million), which would make his sale one of the highest transfers in the history of the Swiss League. His transfer to Manchester City was completed after Caicedo was granted a work permit. Caicedo was described by his manager as "one of the great South American talents" and was also compared to the Brazilian Adriano. He made his debut on 10 February 2008, in a 2–1 away win against rivals
