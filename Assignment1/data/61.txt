Reggina Calcio are an Italian association football club, the main club of the city of Reggio Calabria. Founded in 1914, they currently play in the Italian Serie B, and play their home matches at the 27,763 seater Stadio Oreste Granillo. They are nicknamed amaranto (amaranth) after their official colour.
The club was founded in 11 January 1914 as Unione Sportiva Reggio Calabria, and changed name many times (Società Calcistica Reggio, Reggio Foot Ball Club, Associazione Sportiva Reggina, Società Sportiva La Dominante), finally assuming their current denomination in 1986. In recent years, Reggina have been alternating between the top two levels of the Italian league. They reached the Italian top division Serie A for the first time in 1999. Two years later, they lost a relegation playoff against Verona, being consequently relegated to Serie B. Reggina finished third in Serie B in 2002, earning a return to Serie A. In 2003, Reggina survived a relegation playoff against Atalanta.
They were indicted in 2006 for sporting fraud as part of the second wave of Serie A scandal investigations. Originally punished with a 15-point deduction for the Serie A 2006-07, then reduced to 11 points
