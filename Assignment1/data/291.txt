Stadio Ennio Tardini, commonly referred to as just Il Tardini, is a football stadium in Parma, Italy, located near the centre of Parma, between the town centre and the city walls. It is the home of Parma F.C.. The stadium was built in 1923 and was named after one of Parma's former presidents, Ennio Tardini. The stadium is the nineteenth largest football stadium in Italy and the second largest in Emiliaâ€“Romagna with a capacity of 27,906 spectators, although Il Tardini is presently only authorised to admit 23,045. The stadium is the sixth oldest Italian football ground still in use.
The ground underwent significant expansion under Parmalat's ownership of the resident football club in the 1990s, as the ground's seating capacity was increased from around 13,500 to 29,050. In 2006, the capacity was reduced to 27,906 although only 23,045 are authorised to enter for all-seater events and even those seats are very seldom all sold. The expansion has allowed meant a number of Italy matches have been played at the Tardini. Future expansion plans were made public in Italy's eventually unsuccessfully bid for Euro 2016 and would have made the permanent capacity of the stadium 31,397.
