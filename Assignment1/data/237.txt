Jaime Romero Gómez (born 31 July 1990 in Valdeganga, Albacete, Castile-La Mancha) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Granada CF on loan from Udinese Calcio, as a left midfielder.
Romero made his professional debuts with hometown's Albacete Balompié in 2008–09, aged only 18, only missing six Segunda División games (out of 42, 26 starts) and totalling almost 2,400 minutes as the Castile-La Mancha side retained its league status.
In the 2009 summer, he signed for Udinese Calcio in Italy. In his first season in Serie A, he made four league appearances, and mainly played with the club's under-20 team in the Campionato Nazionale Primavera.
In late June 2010, Udinese agreed a double loan deal with A.S. Bari, subject to Romero and Andrea Coda's decision. After appearing for the club during the pre-season, the former eventually moved to the Apulia club on 2 August.
After appearing in less than one fourth of the league games, and also suffering top division relegation, Romero was loaned again, returning to his country and signing for Granada CF. He made his La Liga debut on 27 August 2011, starting and being substituted in the second half of a 0–1 home loss against Real Betis.
