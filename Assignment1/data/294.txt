Stadio Artemio Franchi is a multi-purpose stadium in Siena, Italy. It is currently used mostly for football matches and the home of A.C. Siena. The stadium was built in 1923 and holds 15,373.
It is named after former Italian Football Federation president Artemio Franchi.
In summer 2007, A.C. Siena agreed to rename the stadium into Stadio Artemio Franchi – Montepaschi Arena, to include the name of their main sponsor, Monte dei Paschi di Siena.
During March 2011, A.C. Siena announced plans to build a new stadium on the southern outskirts of the city at Isola d’Arbia. The new stadium, with a capacity of 20,000, features a revolutionary below ground design which was honored with an MIPIM AR Future Projects Award.
