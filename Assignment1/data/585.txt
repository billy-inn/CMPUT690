Antonio Mazzotta (born 2 August 1989) is an Italian footballer who plays as a defender for Crotone, on loan from Lecce and Palermo.
Mazzotta started his career at Eccellenza Sicily amateurs Kamarat, then joining hometown club Palermo in 2006. In August 2009, he was loaned to Lecce who had recently relegated to Serie B. Mazzotta made his debut 6 days later on a 2–6 lost to Sampdoria at Coppa Italia. After winning the 2009–10 Serie B title and therefore ensuring a place in the 2010–11 Serie A, Lecce used its option to buy half of Mazzotta's transfer rights from Palermo and sent the player out on loan to Serie B club Pescara.
In January 2011 he left Pescara due to lack of first team opportunities in order to join fellow Serie B club Crotone, again on loan from Lecce and Palermo. The loan is extended for another year.
Mazzotta represented Italy at youth U-20 level, and was part of the Italian squad at the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup held in Egypt, playing a total four games during the competition, also scoring a goal in the quarter finals against Hungary.
On 11 August 2010 he made his debut with the Italy U-21 team in a friendly match against Denmark.
