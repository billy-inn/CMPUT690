Jan Oblak (born 7 January 1993) is a Slovenian footballer who plays for Rio Ave F.C. on loan from S.L. Benfica in Portugal, as a goalkeeper.
Born in the Upper Carniolan town of Škofja Loka, Oblak started his career in his hometown playing for NK Ločan. At the age of 10, he moved to NK Olimpija Ljubljana, rejecting a contract from Empoli F.C. in favour of a trial at Fulham in 2009, but eventually did not leave, committing his future with a contract extension until 2011.
Oblak made his professional debuts in the 2009–10 season aged only 16, only missing three league games for Olimpija as it ranked in fourth position. On 14 June 2010, he signed a contract with S.L. Benfica, being immediately loaned to fellow top level outfit S.C. Beira-Mar; he finished 2010–11 with S.C. Olhanense, totalling ten bench appearances combined.
Still owned by Benfica, Oblak moved to another Portuguese team, U.D. Leiria, for the 2011–12 season. He made his league debut on 15 January 2012 in a 2–2 away draw against C.D. Nacional.
Oblak was first called by the Slovenia under-21 team in August 2009, replacing injured Jan Koprivec. He made his debut 9 September of that year against France.
