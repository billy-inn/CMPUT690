Enis Nadarević (born 19 July 1987) is a Bosnian footballer who plays professionally for Varese as a striker.
Born in Bihać in the former Yugoslavia, Nadarević moved to Italy as a youth in 2005. He signed a contract to play professional football with A.S. Varese 1910, but was initially unable to play for the club due to restrictions on non-EU players in the Serie B. He spent the 2009–10 season on loan at Serie D side A.S.D. Sanvitese.
Shortly after an Italian court ruled that he could play in Serie B, Nadarević made his league debut in a match against Siena on 18 December 2010.
