Alberto Lopo García (born 5 May 1980) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Getafe CF as a central defender.
His physical style of play results in him being one of the most booked players every season in Spanish football. He spent 16 years of his career - youth years accounted for - at Espanyol.
Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Lopo spent the bulk of his professional career at local RCD Espanyol, where he started to play when he was ten. Soon the coaches noticed his defensive skills and, in April 1999 (aged eighteen), he made his debut in La Liga against Real Zaragoza, thus becoming the first player to have represented the club in all categories.

He would remain a starter at Espanyol under several coaches (Juande Ramos, Javier Clemente, Luis Fernández and Miguel Ángel Lotina) until his departure in May 2006, gaining in the process a reputation as a superb but excessively rough defender. In 2002–03, he was given 14 yellow cards in
