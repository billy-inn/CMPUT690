Rubén Salvador Pérez del Mármol (born 26 April 1989 in Écija, Andalusia) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Real Betis on loan from Atlético Madrid, as a central midfielder.
Having arrived at Atlético Madrid's youth system at age 13, Pérez made his debut for the first team on 15 May 2010, in a 0–3 home loss against Getafe CF, replacing another youth product, injured Borja.
On 25 July 2010, as part of the transfer of Filipe Luís to the Colchoneros, he was loaned to fellow La Liga team Deportivo de La Coruña for two seasons, making his debut for the Galicians on 12 September, playing 80 minutes in the 0–0 draw at Sevilla FC.
In August 2011, after Depor's relegation, Pérez returned to the top division and joined Getafe CF, with Borja Fernández heading in the opposite direction.
