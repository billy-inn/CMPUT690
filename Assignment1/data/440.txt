Lazaros Christodoulopoulos (Greek: Λάζαρος Χριστοδουλόπουλος; born 19 December 1986 in Thessaloniki) is a Greek footballer playing for Panathinaikos and the Greek national team.
Christodoulopoulos is considered one of the most promising young players in Greece. His main strengths are his technique, pace and acceleration with the ball.
His nickname is "The Builder", because during his fall-out in relations with PAOK, he stated that he would be better off being a construction worker than playing for PAOK again.
Christodoulopoulos started his career when he was picked up by Omonoia Sindos (in Thessaloniki) at a young age,and then Neapoli. His impressive performances caught the eye of a PAOK scout, and joined PAOK in the summer of 2004. He has been a mainstay in the PAOK first team proving to be a vital team player.
As of 2008 many European clubs were interested in signing him. He was contracted to PAOK FC until 2008 with minimum fee release clause of €6 million.
In the summer of 2006 he was given a trial by English giants Liverpool F.C. but PAOK was reluctant to sell him at the point. This started a dispute that prevented him from playing for more than half of the 2006–07 season.
