Alejandro Arribas Garrido (born 1 May 1989 in Madrid) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Rayo Vallecano as a central defender.
Arribas began his career in the youth ranks of CF Rayo Majadahonda, being signed by Madrid neighbours Rayo Vallecano in 2008. He spent almost two full seasons with the reserves, making his professional debuts with CDA Navalcarnero in the second half of the 2008–09 season, being regularly used in a relegation-ending campaign, in Segunda División B.
In 2009–10, Arribas helped the Rayo B-team promote to the third level, moving to the main squad shortly after - in Segunda División - and being an automatic first-choice (38 games out of 42) as the club returned to La Liga after eight years.
