Marco Parolo (born 25 January 1985 in Gallarate) is an Italian professional football player currently playing for the Serie A team A.C. Cesena.
Parolo started his career at Como. After the bankruptcy of Como in 2005, he joined Chievo on 30 August 2005 and left for Pistoiese in co-ownership deal. In June 2007 Chievo bought back Parolo and re-sold to Foligno. On 4 July 2008 he returned to Chievo again and sold to "city rival" Verona in co-ownership deal, along with Leonardo Moracci and Domenico Girardi (loan).
He joined Cesena in the next season, rejoining coach Pierpaolo Bisoli.
In June 2010, Cesena excised the rights to sign him in co-ownership deal, for €300,000, and Parolo signed a contract until 2013. After a good season which Parolo earned a national team call-up, Cesena bought the remain 50% rights from Chievo for €3 million and extended his contract to 2015.
He received his first national team call-up on 20 March 2011, for a friendly match and UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying. The technical director of Cesena, Lorenzo Minotti, hinted Parolo would receive a call-up on 15 March in an interview by il Resto del Carlino.
