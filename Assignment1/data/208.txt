Michael Agazzi (born 3 July 1984 in Ponte San Pietro) is an Italian footballer who plays for Cagliari Calcio.
Since 2008â€“09 season, Agazzi has been the first choice goalkeeper, after the departure of Generoso Rossi.
On 9 July 2009 Cagliari Calcio signed the goalkeeper from Serie B club Triestina in a joint ownership deal. However, he would continue to play for Triestina until June 2010.
However, on 1 February 2010 he returned to Cagliari, 5 months earlier. Co-currently, Triestina signed Alex Calderoni as replacement. On 21 June 2010, Cagliari signed the keeper from the relegated side for undisclosed fee (later Triestina re-admitted to Serie B)
He became the first choice goalkeeper for Cagliari in 2010-11 season after the original one, Federico Marchetti, was frozen by the club as punishment. Ivan Pelizzoli, former internationals, also hinted he is the backup of Agazzi instead of Marchetti at the start of season.
