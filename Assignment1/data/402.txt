Roberto Maximiliano Pereyra (born 7 January 1991) is an Argentine footballer currently playing for the Italian club Udinese.
Despite being right-footed, he plays mostly as a left winger.
Pereyra debuted in the Argentine Primera División playing for River Plate on a 0–4 defeat to Huracán, on the 14th fixture of the 2009 Clausura.
Pereyra signed a five-year contract with the Serie A outfit Udinese Calcio before the transfer window closed on 31 August 2011.
Pereyra was selected to represent the Argentine under-20 football team at the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He played all three group games at the tournament, helping Argentina defeat Mexico and North Korea and draw with England. He missed Argentina's 2-1 Round of 16 victory over Egypt through suspension, but returned to the starting line-up in the Quarterfinal clash against Portugal, which Argentina lost on penalty kicks after neither team could score during 120 minutes.
