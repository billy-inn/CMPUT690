Claudio Andrés Bravo Muñoz (born 13 April 1983 in Viluco, Maipo Province) is a Chilean footballer who plays for Real Sociedad in Spain, as a goalkeeper. He is also a Chilean international.
Bravo's father recognized his son's emerging talent and took him to Colo-Colo's youth academy, and he eventually made his professional debut in 2002. There, he was given the nickname Condor Chico, after former club goalkeeper Roberto Rojas.
After an injury to Eduardo Lobos, manager Jaime Pizarro gave Bravo his first chance, which would be however short-lived, as he too was injured, which prompted the subsequent signing of Jonny Walker.
Bravo recovered from injury in mid-2003 and with Lobos still injured, he took over the starting role, which he would never lose again, with his competitor eventually being sold. In the 2003 Apertura and Clausura tournaments, Colo-Colo made the final in both seasons, falling to Cobreloa both times. In 2006, Bravo won his first title with Colo-Colo, in the Apertura. In the final, against arch-rival C.F. Universidad de Chile, he made an acrobatic save to give Colo-Colo the title in penalties.
For 2006–07, Bravo signed a five-year contract with Real Sociedad in Spain,
