Real Racing Club de Santander, S.A.D. is a Spanish football club based in Santander, in the autonomous community of Cantabria. Founded in 1913, it plays in Segunda División, holding home games at Estadio El Sardinero, with a capacity for 22,400 spectators.
Racing de Santander played its first match on 23 February 1913, losing 1–2 to neighbouring Strong. It was officially founded on 14 June, as Santander Racing Club, appearing in its first tournament during that summer (Luis Redonet Trophy) and being admitted to the Northern Federation on 14 November, eventually merging with Santander Foot-ball Club.
In 1929, Racing first reached La Liga, lasting nine consecutive seasons in the category - finishing in second position in its third year - and fluctuating between the first and the second divisions (with four participations in the third) in the following 30 years. In 1949–50, the Cantabrians returned to the top flight after a 10-year absence, scoring 99 goals in only 30 games.
During the period of Francoist Spain, the club was renamed Real Santander in 1941, because of the prohibition of non-Spanish names. The name was restored in 1973 as the team returned to the first division one year
