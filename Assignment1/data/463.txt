San Mames Barria (Spanish: Nuevo San Mamés, English: New San Mames) is the name of the Athletic Bilbao's new football stadium, which is under construction. The stadium will replace the old San Mamés as the home of Athletic Bilbao.
The project was approved in March 2006. Construction is due to start in june 2010. The stadium will have an all-seater capacity of 55,500. The new stadium will be built next to the existing San Mamés on land that was occupied until 2003 by the Bilbao International Trade Fair. Three quarters of the new stadium will be built and then matches will take place in the new stadium, and the old one will be demolished and a new residential development (yet to be named) will be built on the land.
On 26 May 2010 at 12:00pm the ground-breaking ceremony took place at San Mamés. The event was attended by: the Lehendakari of the Basque Country, Patxi López; the Deputy-General of Biscay, José Luis Bilbao; the mayor of Bilbao, Iñaki Azkuna; the Chairman of Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa, Mario Fernández; the President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Ángel María Villar and the President of Athletic Club, Fernando García Macua.
