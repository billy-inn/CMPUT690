Ibson Barreto da Silva, simply Ibson (born 7 November 1983 in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro), is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Flamengo as a central midfielder.
Ibson arrived at Flamengo in 1992, at the age of nine. He was promoted to the club's first team in the 2003 season and made his debut in a match against Vasco da Gama, totalling nine appearances in the Série A that season; his father, Laís Souza, eventually became a scout at the club.
In the following year, Ibson became one of the team's most important players. Under the guidance of Abel Braga and playing alongside the likes of Zinho, Felipe and Jean, he won the Guanabara Cup and the Rio de Janeiro State League, and also finished as runner-up in the Copa do Brasil; that season, he scored 11 goals in a total personal record of 66 matches.
After a good season, some European clubs showed interest in Ibson and, just three matches into the Rio de Janeiro State League, he was transferred to Portuguese giants F.C. Porto, in January 2005. Flamengo received many criticism about his transfer, most of it coming from the transfer values, around US$2,5 million. At the time, club directors said they cashed the money as his contract
