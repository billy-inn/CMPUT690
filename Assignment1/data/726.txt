Emiliano Viviano (born 1 December 1985 in Florence) is an Italian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Serie A club Palermo, in a co-ownership deal with Internazionale.
He is a product of Fiorentina and Brescia youth teams. He started his career with a loan in Serie B at Cesena in the 2004–05 season. Then he spent 4 years as first choice goalkeeper in Serie B with Brescia.
In January 2009 Viviano signed by Internazionale in co-ownership deal for €3.5 million. He was immediately loaned back to Brescia. In the 2009–10 season he made his debut in Serie A with Bologna where he became the first choice goalkeeper. Bologna signed him in by bought Brescia's 50% registration rights for undisclosed fee (which had €3.5 million nominal value).
On 25 June 2011, Viviano rejoined Inter from Bologna after Lega Serie A announced the result of co-ownership deals. It was due to an administrative error allowed him to join Inter for a fee of €4.1 million. The error came as the Bologna club director Stefano Pedrelli accidentally halved again the initial €4.71 million valuation of the remaining 50% of his contract to bid only €2.33 million in response to Inter's €4.1 million valuation on the bid
