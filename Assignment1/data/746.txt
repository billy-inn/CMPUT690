Rolando Bianchi (Italian pronunciation: [roˈlando ˈbjanki]; born February 15, 1983 in Lovere, Bergamo) is an Italian footballer, currently playing for Torino F.C.. His position is centre forward. He was widely considered as one of the brightest promises of Italian football, notably scoring 19 goals in the 2006–2007 season playing with Calabrian club Reggina.
Bianchi began his career in 2000 with Atalanta. He played twenty games for the first team, without scoring, despite being a prolific scorer in the youth ranks. He was loaned to Serie B team Cagliari in January 2004, where he played 14 matches and scored 2 goals helping them gain promotion to Serie A. The 2004–05 was a poor one for the forward, and saw him score only 2 goals in 25 matches.
Bianchi was promptly sold to Reggina in 2005, where his first season was hampered by a serious knee injury suffered early on in the season. He recovered to play 9 games late in the season, scoring one goal.
That summer, Bianchi was called up the Italy U-21 squad for the 2006 U-21 Championships in Portugal, where he appeared 3 times and scored once.
The 2006–07 season saw the forward in superb form for Reggina, notching 18 goals in 37 games.
