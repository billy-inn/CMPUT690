Alessandro Rosina (Italian pronunciation: [alesˈsandro roˈzina]; born 31 January 1984) is an Italian footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or winger for Russian Premier League club Zenit St. Petersburg.
Born in Belvedere Marittimo, Rosina started his career at Cittadella del Capo youth team at the age of five, where he caught the eye of Juventus, Roma and Milan scouts. His father, however, decided to let him join Parma. He was subsequently brought up in the club's youth system.
Rosina spent 2001–2002 playing for Parma Primavera team. He was promoted to the first team next season, making his professional debut on 16 February 2003 against Juventus as a substitute for Hidetoshi Nakata. In two and a half years at the club, he made 25 league appearances. Rosina was a member of B squad in 2003–04 UEFA Cup.
With a change of team's formation, Rosina found first-team opportunities hard to come by. In January 2005 he was loaned to Hellas Verona, where he had a hugely successful spell. After the end of the loan he was bought by Torino, then in Serie B.
Rosina was regarded as a revelation since his arrival to the club. He became the driving force behind Torino's 2005–2006 promotion
