André Filipe Ribeiro Leão (born 20 May 1985 in Freamunde) is a Portuguese footballer who plays for F.C. Paços de Ferreira as a central midfielder.
After a brief spell with F.C. Porto's reserves, Leão made his professional debuts at Aveiro's S.C. Beira-Mar, his first division debut coming on 17 September 2006 in a 2–0 home win against C.F. Estrela da Amadora. He was used regularly during that season, but only won one of the matches in which he appeared, and his club was relegated.
Leão then moved to Romania with CFR Cluj, joining a host of compatriots, and winning the national championship in his debut season, appearing in 15 games; however, he would be rarely used during his two 1/2-year spell, and returned to his country in the late hours of the January 2010 transfer window, joining F.C. Paços de Ferreira.
In the 2010 off-season, Swansea City of the Football League Championship made an offer to sign Leão.
