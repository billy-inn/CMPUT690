The Stadio Oreste Granillo is a football stadium in Reggio Calabria, Italy. It is the home of Reggina Calcio. The stadium was built in 1999 on the foundations of Comunale and holds 27,763. It is named after former Reggina president Oreste Granillo who led the club to Serie B for the first time and became mayor of the city.
The stadium was first built in 1932, then known as the Stadio Michele Bianchi. Then-Reggina president Giuseppe Vilardi was behind its construction. For years it was the only stadium in the city and changed names many times, mainly known as the Comunale.
Many renovations have been made on the structure, with the cover over the grandstand being built in the 60's and the Curva Nord, where Reggina fans stand today being built in the 80s'. The curva was not part of the original structure.
In order to accommodate a growing number of fans, coinciding with the success achieved by Reggina, the stadium was substantially renovated. In 1997, the old structure was demolished and two years later the new Stadio Oreste Granillo was completed, completely rebuilt on the same surface where the Michele Bianchi was first constructed, almost 70 years earlier.
