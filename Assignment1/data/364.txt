Hércules Club de Fútbol, S.A.D. (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈerkules]) is a Spanish football team based in Alicante, in the autonomous community of Valencia. Founded in 1922, it currently plays in the Spanish second division, and holds home games at the Estadio José Rico Pérez, which seats 30,000 spectators.
After first appearing in La Liga in 1935–36, Hércules would play sporadically in the category for the next forty years, playing mainly in the second division but going as low as Tercera División. From 1961–69, neighbours Alicante CF acted as its feeder club.
After a ten-year spell in the topflight, encompassing 12 seasons in the 1970s/80s, the club only returned again in 1996–97; though finally relegated, it managed two remarkable comeback wins over FC Barcelona, which ultimately handed over the league title to Real Madrid.
In 2004–05, after five years in the third division, Hércules finished second, being subsequently promoted to the second level. After posting three consecutive solid seasons, the club would narrowly miss on a return to the top division in 2008–09, finishing fourth, three points behind last-promotee CD Tenerife.
2009–10 saw Hércules promoted back into the top
