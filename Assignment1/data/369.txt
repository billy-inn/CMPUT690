Frederik Hillesborg Sørensen (born 14 April 1992) is a Danish footballer who plays for Serie A club Bologna F.C, on loan from Juventus.
Sørensen began playing football at hometown clubs Roskilde KFUM and FC Roskilde before joining Lyngby in 2007. After breaking into the first team, he was awarded with a contract until 2013.
Sørensen left for Turin on 27 August 2010 after a trial with Juventus in July. He was a member of Juventus's Primavera team in the 2010–11 season. After injuries to Leandro Rinaudo and Zdeněk Grygera that would rule them out for several months, Sørensen was called up to the first team for the first time against Bologna and then against Milan. In the next league match, on 7 November 2010, due to the unavailability of center backs Giorgio Chiellini and Nicola Legrottaglie, Sørensen made his first start alongside Leonardo Bonucci in the centre of defense. In that match, The Old Lady beat Cesena 3–1. In the next match, right back Marco Motta was suspended and Sørensen replaced him against A.S. Roma. From that match onwards Sørensen has continued to impress and has continued to make regular appearances for Juventus as a right back. On the long awaited Derby D'Italia
