Carlos Javier Acuña Caballero (born 23 June 1988 in Encarnación) is a Paraguayan footballer who plays for Girona FC as a striker.
In 2004, Acuña helped Paraguay win the U16 South American Championship, also topping the goal charts. He was immediately bought by Cádiz CF of Spain, for a then club record of around 100 million pesetas. He had to wait one year in the sidelines, however, to make his first team debut, as the Andalusians already had its foreign-players quota full.
From 2006–08, Acuña represented Cádiz and UD Salamanca, both in the second division (the latter on loan). On 17 December 2008, Real Madrid's official website confirmed an agreement for the transfer of the player, for five years. He was immediately sent into the B squad.
