Roberto Canella Suárez (born 7 February 1988 in Laviana, Asturias) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Sporting de Gijón as a left defender.
A product of Sporting de Gijón's cantera system, Canella first appeared with the main side during 2006–07, and established himself as first-choice in the following year, as the Asturias side returned to La Liga after a 10-year hiatus.
He scored his first top flight goal on 5 October 2008, in a 2–0 win at RCD Mallorca, being first-choice throughout the campaign. According to COPE Radio, Real Madrid was likely to acquire his services for 2009–10. Eventually, nothing came of it, and the player again occupied the left-back position for the vast majority of the season, with Sporting again maintaining its top division status.
In the following seasons, Canella continued battling for position with another club youth graduate, José Ángel, with both players appearing in roughly the same number of matches. In 2011–12, following Ángel's departure to A.S. Roma, he became the undisputed starter for the Manolo Preciado-led side.
Internationally, Canella helped Spain win the 2006 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship, played at the 2007 FIFA U-20
