It was the beginning of a new era a farewell to the Algirós, which will always remain in the memories of Valencians as the club's first home. A long and rich history has taken played out on the field of the Mestalla since its very beginning, and before Valencia CF was in Primera División. Back then, the stadium could hold up to 17,000 spectators, and the club started to show its potential in regional championships which led to a decision by management to carry out the first renovations of the Mestalla in 1927. As a result the stadium's seating capacity was increased to 25,000. Unfortunately the stadium was severely damaged during the Spanish Civil War.
