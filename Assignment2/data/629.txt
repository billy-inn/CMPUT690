On 12 February 2009 Vélez Sársfield of Argentine Primera División signed him on loan until the end of the season. He started successfully at Vélez scoring in his debut game against Tigre. He also scored against Godoy Cruz and Rosario Central. However, after this last one (which was in the 7th game of the Clausura tournament) he couldn't score again.
