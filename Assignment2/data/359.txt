Sergi Gómez Solà (born 28 March 1992 in Arenys de Mar, Barcelona, Catalonia) is a Spanish footballer who plays for FC Barcelona B as a central defender.
Gómez arrived in FC Barcelona's youth academy at the age of 14. Even though he appeared in only three league games for the B team in the 2009–10 season, he would later play an essential role in the Catalonia side's Segunda División successful promotion play-offs, after injury to another youth graduate, Andreu Fontàs.
On 13 August 2010, as first-team manager Josep Guardiola provided Barça's Spanish internationals with needed rest, Gómez was included in the nineteen-man squad to face Sevilla FC in the first leg of the 2010 season's Spanish Supercup. He made his official competitive debut in that game, a 1–3 away loss, playing the full ninety minutes.
