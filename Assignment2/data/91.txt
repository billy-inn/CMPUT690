Real Club Deportivo Mallorca is a Spanish football team based on Palma, Majorca, in the Balearic Islands. Founded on 5 March 1916, the team currently plays in the Spanish first division, holding home games at the Iberostar Stadium.
Team colours are red shirts with black shorts and black socks.
The oldest club in the Balearic Islands, Mallorca was originally founded in 1916 by Adolfo Vázquez, a republican engineer, who named the club Junta Directiva del Alfonso XIII FBC after the then Spanish king. The first stadium, called Buenos Aires, was inaugurated on 25 March of that year, with a 0–8 loss against FC Barcelona. A year later, the club changed its name to Real Sociedad Alfonso XIII, a denomination which remained until 1931 when, for political reasons, the team was named Club Deportivo Mallorca. In 1949 it was granted royal patronage, thus adding the Real prefix.
In 1931, Mallorca started competing in the national categories. On 22 September 1945, Es Fortí, the club's new ground, was inaugurated, and the team first reached Segunda División in 1959, and La Liga just one season later, going on to appear in the top flight a further four times unti 1975.
