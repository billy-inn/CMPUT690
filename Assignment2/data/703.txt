Vicente Guaita Panadero (born 18 February 1987 in Torrente, Horta Oest, Valencia) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Valencia CF as a goalkeeper.
A Valencia CF youth system graduate, Guaita was promoted to the first team for 2008–09, following the retirement of historical Santiago Cañizares. Additionally, as German Timo Hildebrand became ostracized by coach Unai Emery, he became the backup.
Guaita made his official first team debut on 2 October 2008, in a UEFA Cup tie against C.S. Marítimo (2–1 home win). However, after the signing of veteran César Sánchez from Tottenham Hotspur, later in the year, and the full recovery of Renan, he remained third-choice until the end of the season.
In 2009–10, with Sánchez having renewed his link a further year and the signing of RCD Mallorca's Miguel Ángel Moyà, Guaita was deemed surplus to requirements and joined, on loan, second division's Recreativo de Huelva. As the Andalusians finished comfortably in mid-table, he was crowned the competition's Zamora, with just 24 goals conceded in 30 appearances.
In November-December 2010, profiting from injuries to both César and Moyà, Guaita had a run of several matches for Valencia, notably a 2–1 home
