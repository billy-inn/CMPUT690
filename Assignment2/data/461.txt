Sergio Canales Madrazo (born 16 February 1991 in Santander, Cantabria) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Real Madrid, as an attacking midfielder.
A product of hometown Racing de Santander's youth ranks, Canales was bought by Deportivo de La Coruña – 50% of the player's rights – in 2006, as part of the deal which saw Pedro Munitis return to Cantabria. Dudu Aouate and Antonio Tomás were also involved, in the opposite direction.
On 18 September 2008, he made his first team debut with Racing, playing in a UEFA Cup home tie against FC Honka of Finland (1–0 win). Roughly two weeks later, he first appeared in La Liga, at CA Osasuna (same result).
Having gradually received more playing time with the main squad, Canales scored twice against RCD Espanyol on 6 December 2009 (4–0 away win), and repeated the feat at Sevilla FC on 9 January 2010 (2–1 at the Estadio Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán), receiving Man of the match accolades in the latter game. The following week, as Racing drew at home to Real Valladolid 1–1, he also found the net, and eventually finished his first full season with six goals and four assists, helping Racing narrowly avoid relegation.
