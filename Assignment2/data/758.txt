Jonathas Cristian de Jesus (born 6 March 1989), commonly known as Jonathas, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a forward for Italian club Brescia.
Jonathas has played in Cruzeiro's youth teams and a few times in the senior team. He has also been loaned out to Ipatinga and Villa Nova. In October 2008 he was signed by Dutch Eredivisie-champions, AZ Alkmaar. Cruzeiro announced that AZ bought 65% player's rights for €600,000 and the Brazilian club retained the rest.
Before playing for the first team, Jonathas had to adapt to the Dutch language and the style of play, so he started out at the youth team, where he impressed by scoring many goals.
Jonathas made his debut for AZ on 28 October 2009, in the cup match against Spakenburg. He scored a goal, and AZ eventually won the match with 5–2. On 21 November 2009, Jonathas played his first league match for the club from Alkmaar. It was in the away match against Limburgian side, Roda JC. He also scored a goal in his league debut, and the 2–4 score for AZ. In the 90th minute of that match, Jonathas was sent off after accidentally hitting an opponent with his arm.
In January 2011 Jonathas was signed by Brescia Calcio for €300,000 in 1½
