Haris Medunjanin (born 8 March 1985) is a Bosnian footballer who plays for Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. in Israel. Mainly a attacking midfielder, he can also appear as an left midfielder.
He has dual citizenship, Bosnian and Dutch.
Medunjanin was born in Sarajevo. Due to the Bosnian War in 1992, he moved to the Netherlands at the age of seven, with his mother and sister. 
Medunjanin made his Eredivisie debut on February 20, 2005, with AZ Alkmaar, but opportunities were scarce during his three-year spell at the club. In 2006–07, he was loaned to Sparta Rotterdam, being essential as the modest outfit finished 13th in the season, with seven league goals.
After another unassuming season with AZ, Medunjanin was snapped by Spain's Real Valladolid in August 2008, being relatively used in his debut season (mainly from the bench).
In June 2010, after Valladolid's relegation – during the season, he scored all of his five La Liga goals as a late substitute – Medunjanin signed for Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. of Israel for €1.800.000, penning a four-year contract. On July 15, he made his official debut for the club, in a UEFA Europa League second qualifying round against FK Mogren, and scored in a 2–0 home
