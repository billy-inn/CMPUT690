Saphir Sliti Taïder (born 29 February 1992 in Castres) is a French football player who currently plays for Serie A club Bologna on loan from Juventus.
Sliti Taïder was born in France to a Tunisian father and an Algerian mother of Kabyle descent. He frequently visits Algeria and has both Algerian and Tunisian passports.
He is the younger brother of Tunisian international Nabil Taïder who currently plays for Tunisian club Étoile du Sahel.
Taïder made his professional debut with Grenoble on 15 May 2010 in a league match against Marseille. On 5 July 2010, Taïder signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Grenoble.
Following Grenoble's fall to the Championnat de France amateur 2, the fifth division of French football, due to financial problems in 2011, Taïder joined Italian club Bologna. On 16 January 2012, he made his first start in Serie A in the 1–1 draw against Napoli. A day later, it was announced that Taïder was signed by Juventus on a co-ownership deal in which the Dane Frederik Sorensen headed the other way.
Sliti Taïder is a France youth international and is currently playing on the under-20 team.
