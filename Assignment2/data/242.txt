Fayçal Fajr (born 1 August 1988) is a French football player who plays for French club Caen in Ligue 1. He plays as an attacking midfielder and is of Moroccan origin.
Fajr was born in the city of Rouen and began his career with local amateur club Sottevillais Cheminots. In 2000, he joined the youth academy of professional club Le Havre. After three years, Fajr was released after being told he lacked the physical requirements to remain. He, subsequently, returned home to join hometown club Rouen. Fajr spent two years at the club and, in 2005, signed a contract with CMS Oissel. With Oissel, he played in the Championnat de France amateur 2, the fifth division of French football.
After two seasons playing on the senior team of Oissel, in 2008, Fajr moved up one division to sign with Étoile Fréjus Saint-Raphaël, then known as ES Fréjus. In his first season with the club, he appeared in 29 matches scoring four goals. Fréjus finished second in its group, however, due to the Direction Nationale du Contrôle de Gestion (English: National Directorate of Management Control) (DNCG) imposing sanctions on several clubs in the Championnat National, the club was given a spot in the third division.
