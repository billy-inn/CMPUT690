Villarreal Club de Fútbol, S.A.D. (Valencian: Vila-real Club de Futbol, S.A.D.), usually abbreviated to Villarreal CF or just Villarreal, is a Spanish football club based in Vila-real, a city in the province of Castellón within the Valencian Community. Founded in 1923, it plays in Segunda División, holding home games at El Madrigal, with a capacity for 24,890 spectators.
The club is nicknamed El Submarino Amarillo (Yellow Submarine) due to its yellow home kit, and due to being a low-profile team compared to Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, and Valencia CF, whom they have challenged for trophies over the last decade. Villarreal has often been touted as an example of small but successful club.
Villarreal CF was founded as Villarreal CD on 10 March 1923 "to promote all sports especially football." The stadium was rented for 60 pesetas a month and ticket prices were set at half a peseta for men and a quarter of a peseta for children. Women were granted free admission. On 17 June 1923, CD Castellón, a modern rival of the club, played the first match against a club named after Cervantes. On 21 October of that year, Villarreal played their first game ever, playing against Castellón. Villarreal
