Rafael Márquez Álvarez (born 13 February 1979 in Zamora, Michoacán) is a Mexican footballer who plays for New York Red Bulls in Major League Soccer and the Mexico national team. He plays as a centre back or defensive midfielder.
He spent over a decade playing in France and Spain and is considered one of the best Mexican defenders of all time. He won numerous titles with Monaco and FC Barcelona. After winning the 2006 UEFA Champions League with Barcelona, he became the first Mexican to win the honour, something Mexican legend Hugo Sánchez was not able to do while playing for Real Madrid.
Márquez began his career at Mexican club Atlas, for whom he débuted in 1996 at only 17 years old. Márquez rose to prominence while with Atlas, making 77 appearances for the team and being runner-up in the league losing the final against Deportivo Toluca in penalties.
In 1996, Monaco purchased him for €7 million. Monaco scouts had gone to see Pablo Contreras during the Copa América tournament. After seeing Márquez play, they signed both players. In his first season, he helped lead Monaco to become Ligue 1 champions, in which he played a vital part in defence. In 2003, Márquez was signed by La Liga
