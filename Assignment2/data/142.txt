Iván Rodrigo Piris (born 10 March 1989) is a Paraguayan football right defender who currently plays for São Paulo.
Piris spent 3 years at the Paraguayan giants, playing a particularly large role in Cerro Porteno's run to the semi-finals of the 2011 Copa Libertadores. However, his impressive performance in the competition alerted clubs around the world of his ability and it looked unlikely that he would stay with Cerro Porteno. Sure enough, Piris was tracked by both Manchester United of England and Boca Juniors of Argentina  as well as Tottenham Hotspur, S.L. Benfica, F.C. Porto, Bologna FC and Udinese. However, Piris eventually signed for Brazilian club São Paulo FC for a fee of 2 million euros.
Piris joined up with his new team-mates after the 2011 Copa America after São Paulo announced his signing on Thursday 15 July  São Paulo's vice-president spoke of his delight at signing Piris: "For months we have been working quietly on this player and to see it succeed makes us very happy", he told the club's official website. "Piris is a young athlete who has lots of potential. He will definitely add great quality to our group."
