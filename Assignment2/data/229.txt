Ángel Luis Rodríguez Díaz (born 26 April 1987 in Santa Cruz de Tenerife), simply Ángel, is a Spanish footballer who plays for Elche CF as a forward.
Ángel emerged through the youth ranks of local CD Tenerife, netting seven second division goals in his first full professional season. He split 2007–08 on loan with two third level teams, including Real Madrid Castilla.
Returning to the Canary Islands in 2008–09, Ángel was an important offensive element as the club returned to La Liga after a seven-year absence. He made his debut in the competition on 29 August 2009 in a 0–1 away loss against Real Zaragoza (ten minutes played), and contributed with one goal in 24 games – all as a substitute – during the season, but the team was eventually immediately relegated back.
