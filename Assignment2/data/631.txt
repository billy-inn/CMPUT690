Miguel Ángel Moyà Rumbo (born 2 April 1984 in Binissalem, Majorca, Balearic Islands) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Valencia CF as a goalkeeper.
Moyà made his professional debuts with hometown RCD Mallorca on 29 August 2004, a 0–1 home loss against Real Madrid, appearing in 32 league games for a team that barely avoided relegation (17th). After backing up another youth system product, veteran Toni Prats, for two years, he became the undisputed starter.
From 2007–09, however, Moyà struggled mightily with injuries, only appearing in thirteen matches in the latter season.
In late June 2009, Moyà agreed on a move to fellow La Liga outfit Valencia CF, for about €5 million. On 5 August, in the club's preseason 0–2 defeat at Manchester United, he featured more than 30 minutes as central midfielder, after all the replacements had been made by Unai Emery and an injury occurred; the score was then at 0–1. He made his official debut against Sevilla FC in the league's opener, a 2–0 home win, but quickly lost his job to veteran César Sánchez, after some costly mistakes.
On 15 June 2011, Moyà joined Getafe CF on loan, as part of the deal involving Daniel Parejo.
