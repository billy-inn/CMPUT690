Mateus Alberto Contreiras Gonçalves (born 7 March 1983 in Luanda), better known as Manucho, is an Angolan footballer who currently plays for Real Valladolid.
He moved from Petro Atletico to Manchester United in January 2008. Before playing a game for United, however, he was loaned out to Greek side Panathinaikos for the remainder of the 2007–08 season, due to issues with obtaining a UK work permit. Manucho received a work permit soon after returning to Manchester United for pre-season training in July 2008, and made his debut for the club in the League Cup against Middlesbrough on 23 September 2008. Short of first team opportunities at Old Trafford, however, on 16 January 2009 he joined Hull City on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season. Having failed to break into the Manchester United first team, Manucho joined Real Valladolid in July 2009. He is also a member of the Angolan national team.
Manucho began his football career at Flamenguinhos, a small youth football club from Terra Nova, Luanda, where he lived. Under the guidance of his coach and father, Alberto Gonçalves, Manucho plied his trade as a left winger, becoming one of the club's top stars.
