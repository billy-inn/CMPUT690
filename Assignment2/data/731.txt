Estadio El Sadar (between 2005-2011, known as Reyno de Navarra) is a football stadium in Pamplona, Navarre, Spain. It takes the name from the Kingdom of Navarre. The stadium holds 19,553 people. It was built in 1967 and is the home of CA Osasuna. It is currently used mostly for football matches.
The name uses the medieval Spanish word reyno instead of the modern reino ("kingdom", derived from rey, "king") which lends it a somehow archaic touch. From 1967 to 2005 and since 2012 again, the stadium was called "El Sadar", named after a river near to the stadium.
Opened in 1967 as El Sadar, the stadium replaced the San Juan stadium that was sold the previous year. The stadium accommodated a capacity of 25,000 spectators at its opening with only 7,000 of those seated. Its inaugural game was played on 2 September between Zaragoza and Portuguese side Vitoria de Setúbal and ended in a one-all draw. The following day Osasuna defeated Vitoria de Setúbal 3-0 for its first win in the new stadium. Osaba scored the first goal for Osasuna in El Sadar in the 28th minute.
Bon Jovi performed at the stadium during their These Days Tour on June 5, 1996.
