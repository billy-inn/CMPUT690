Borja Ekiza Imaz (born 6 March 1988 in Pamplona, Navarre) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Athletic Bilbao as a central defender.
Ekiza arrived at Athletic Bilbao's youth system at the age of 14, being eligible to represent the Basque through his Navarrese roots. He spent his first two senior years with CD Baskonia, the club's third team.
Subsequently, Ekiza played with the reserves in Segunda División B, being sparingly used in two seasons. On 8 January 2011, after a string of injuries to the defensive sector in the first team awarded him with promotion to the main squad, he made his La Liga debut in a 1–1 away draw against Málaga CF, playing the full 90 minutes; he finished his first top flight season established in the side's starting XI, beating competition from seasoned veterans Fernando Amorebieta, Aitor Ocio and Ustaritz, and being booked only once throughout the entire campaign.
