Alessandro Gamberini (born 27 August 1981 in Bologna) is an Italian footballer who plays for ACF Fiorentina in Serie A, as a central defender.
Gamberini made his first team – and Serie A – debut with Bologna F.C. 1909 in 1999–2000 – in a 1–3 away defeat against S.S. Lazio on 9 January 2000 – and remained there for six seasons, a one-year loan to Hellas Verona notwithstanding. In the 2000 off-season, he was acquired by Juventus F.C. alongside Alex Pederzoli and Giacomo Cipriani in a pack deal for 10 (short) billion Lire (€5.16 million), in exchange for the remaining 50% of Jonatan Binotto's registration rights also for 10 billion Lire (€5.16 million), with 50% of Gamberini's rights being priced at €2.324 million. His co-ownership deal was terminated in the favour of Bologna in June 2002, for a peppercorn fee, making the Turin side register a loss of €1.502 million (the residual unamortised transfer fee of €4.648M in three years), but with a financial income of €2.324 million as Juve did not have to pay the remaining 50% registration rights.
Following Bologna's relegation in 2004–05, Gamberini moved to ACF Fiorentina for €3.2 million, carving a starting XI niche in his second year,
