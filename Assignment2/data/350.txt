Hassan Yebda (born 14 May 1984) is an Algerian footballer who plays for Granada CF in Spain and the Algeria national team, as a central midfielder.
During his professional career, he played in France, Portugal, England, Italy and Spain, representing a host of clubs.
Yebda is a former French youth international and was part of the team that won the 2001 U-17 World Championship. He opted to play for Algeria at senior level in August 2009, taking advantage of FIFA’s new ruling which allowed him to change his national allegiance despite being older than 21 years of age, and represented the latter national team at the 2010 World Cup and the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations.
Born in Saint-Maurice, Yebda emerged through AJ Auxerre's youth system, but made no appearances for the first team during his stint, playing regularly for the reserves in the Championnat de France amateur.
In January 2006, he was loaned to second division's Stade Lavallois. In the same month of the following year, Yebda was definitely released and moved to Le Mans UC72, making his top level debut on 17 February 2007 in a 0–2 away loss against FC Sochaux-Montbéliard: brought on in the 70th minute, he scored an own goal ten
