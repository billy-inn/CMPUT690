Miguel Pérez Cuesta (born 21 March 1986 in Oviedo, Asturias), aka Michu, is a Spanish footballer who plays for Rayo Vallecano as an attacking midfielder.
After beginning with local Real Oviedo in the lower leagues, Michu moved to Celta de Vigo B in Segunda División B in 2007. Midway through 2007–08, he received his maiden first-team callup, finishing the season in the starting XI of the Segunda División outfit.
In mid-January 2010, a transfer to La Liga with Sporting de Gijón, in order to replace Birmingham City-bound Míchel, was almost arranged, but it eventually fell through and Michu stayed at Celta.
In his last two second level seasons combined, Michu scored 12 goals for the Galicians. On 8 June 2011, after helping the club to the sixth position in the regular season, he scored the game's only goal in the first leg of the promotion playoffs against Granada CF, at home; in the second leg, however, he missed his penalty shootout attempt and Celta was eliminated (4–5).
On 27 July 2011, after his contract with Celta expired, Michu signed a two-year deal with Rayo Vallecano, freshly promoted to the top division.
