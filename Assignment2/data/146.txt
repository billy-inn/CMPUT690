Ishak Belfodil (born 12 January 1992 in Mostaganem) is a Franco-Algerian football player who currently plays for Italian club Bologna in the Serie A on loan from French club Lyon. He is a France youth international having earned caps at under-17, under-18, and under-19 level.
Belfodil began his football career at OSC Ã‰lancourt, a club located in the western suburbs of Paris, and spent his formative years at the club. He later joined nearby club Trappes FC. While at Trappes, Belfodil passed the entrance tests required to attend the Clairefontaine academy, but was not selected following failure of the final test. As a result, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain spending only a year at the Camp des Loges, the club's training center. Belfodil attributed only one year there primarily due to not focusing on his studies and not receiving enough playing time with his youth section. In 2004, he joined AC Boulogne Billencourt, a sports club that also trained international players Hatem Ben Arfa and Issiar Dia. In 2007, Belfodil secured a move to Ligue 2 club Clermont Foot.
