Welliton Soares de Morais, or simply Welliton, (born 22 October 1986 in Conceição do Araguaia) is a Brazilian football striker who plays for Spartak Moscow.
Welliton started his career playing for the Brazilian side Goiás. In July 2007 he moved to Russian club Spartak Moscow, signing a five year contract. He has been a very prolific scorer and won the top scorer title in the 2009 and 2010 seasons.
To begin the 2008 season, Welliton scored six times in his first nine matches. Former Russia midfielder Aleksandr Mostovoi heaped praise on the young striker after his performance in a 3–0 away win at Rubin, stating "He has overcome all problems with passage into a new country. He is young, fast, technical, an ideal artist who acts along the entire front line of attack, not just along the flanks as this past season." Unfortunately, his stellar start was cut short due to a muscle tear that forced him out of action for 10 months.
After a successful return in 2009, Welliton helped Spartak early to a prime position to qualify for the UEFA Champions League after finishing a dismal 8th place in 2008. He scored his first career hat-trick on 8 August 2009 at Spartak Nalchik. He scored six goals
