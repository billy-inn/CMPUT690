Brought through the youth ranks of local team Celta de Vigo, Aspas made his first team debut in 2007–08, with the club in the second division (it would be his only of the campaign).
He was definitely promoted from the reserves for the 2009–10 season, going on to appear in several more campaigns in the second level with the Galicians. In 2011–12 he scored a career-best 23 league goals (14 more than his first two full seasons combined), second-best in the competition behind UD Almería's Leonardo Ulloa, as his team returned to La Liga after a five-year absence.
