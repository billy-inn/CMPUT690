Marco Capuano (born 14 October 1991 in Pescara) is an Italian footballer who currently plays as a defender for Serie A club Pescara.
A local-born product of Pescara's youth system, Capuano made his debut with the senior team in the away draw for 1–1 against Frosinone. He obtained 10 appearances in the 2010–11 Serie B season. He also signed a new 3-year contract in December 2010.
During the 2011-12 season, Capuano became a more regular starter under new manager Zdeněk Zeman. His run in the starting eleven was soured by a controversial straight red card which led to a penalty in the 20 November match against Gubbio.
On 1 June 2011 he made his debut with the Italy U-21 team, in the game against Côte d'Ivoire.
