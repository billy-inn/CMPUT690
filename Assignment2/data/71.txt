Getafe Club de Fútbol is a Spanish La Liga football club based in Getafe, a city in the Madrid metropolitan area, founded in 1946 and refounded in 1983.
In the top level since 2004–05, it holds home games at the Coliseum Alfonso Pérez.
On April 25, 2011 the club was bought by the Dubai-based Royal Emirates Group for between €70 and €90 million euros.
The first season of play for Getafe Club de Fútbol was in 1945, when five Getafe locals, Enrique Condes García, Aurelio Miranda Olavaria, Antonio Corridor Lozano, Manuel Serrano Vergara and Miguel Cubero Francés, decided to form a team of the area while meeting at the "La Marquesina" bar. Officially founded on February 24, 1946, the club was named Club Getafe Deportivo.
The club originally played in Campo del Regimiento de Artillería, which lacked goal posts. Shortly after, the club moved to San Isidro, housed in the current Municipal Sports Center of San Isidro. Here, Club Getafe was promoted to the third division following their victory against CP Villarrobledo in the 1956/57 season. Getafe was nearly promoted to the Segunda during 1957/58, but was defeated by C.D. Almería.
On September 2, 1970, the club inaugurated its own stadium
