Estadio Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán is a stadium in Seville, Spain. It is the home stadium of Sevilla Fútbol Club. It was the venue for the 1986 European Cup Final between Steaua Bucureşti and Barcelona and the 1982 World Cup semi-final game between Germany and France.
This stadium contains a singular legend: the Spanish national team has never lost a game against an international team in this stadium. In European competition, Sevilla has lost only twice at home, once to AZ in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup Group Stage, and once to CSKA Moskva in the 2009-10 UEFA Champions League.
The stadium holds 45,500 and was built in 1957. It replaced Estadio Nervion.
The stadium is nicknamed "La Bombonera" (more commonly used to refer to Estadio Alberto J. Armando, the home stadium of Boca Juniors) or "La Bombonera de Nervión" due to the Nervión neighbourhood where the stadium is situated.
