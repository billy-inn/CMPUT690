His Eredivisie debut came on March 29, 2008 in a goalless draw against Heracles Almelo. However, he did not make any appearances the following season.
In January 2010, Tytoń became the club's first choice goalkeeper, taking over from Bram Castro. He had shoulder surgery at the end of March 2011.
After 2010–11 Eredivisie season, Tytoń was listed as the second best goalkeeper, only behind Maarten Stekelenburg. He had an offer from Belgian champion KRC Genk, but did not accept it.
