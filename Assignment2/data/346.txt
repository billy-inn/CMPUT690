Yohan Benalouane (Arabic: يوهان بن علوان‎) (born March 28, 1987 in Bagnols-sur-Cèze) is a Tunisian–French football defender. He currently plays in Italy for A.C. Cesena.
Benalouane was included in the Tunisian squad for the first time in August 2010 to face Chad in an African Cup of Nations qualifier, but missed the game because he failed vaccination prior the travel to Chad. He took the chance to refuse to rejoin the Tunisian squad. FIFA made it clear the he can not join France anymore and that he has to rally Tunisia against Togo in October 2010 which he did not so now he lost privilege to join either national team.
After a particularly poor performance in a 2-0 loss against Bologna in December 2010, Benalouane was substituted. On leaving the pitch, and being jeered by Cesena supporters, he stormed past the bench and headed straight down the tunnel. He later publicly apologised for his behaviour.
