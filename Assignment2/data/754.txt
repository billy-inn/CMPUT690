Luca Ceccarelli (born 24 March 1983) is an Italian footballer who plays for Cesena in Serie A.
Born in Gambettola, the Province of Forlì-Cesena, Ceccarelli started his career at Cesena. He won Serie C1 promotion playoffs in 2004. He then loaned back to Serie C1 clubs Pavia and San Marino Calcio. After Cesena was relegated in June 2008, Ceccarelli returned to the team for their Lega Pro Prima Divisione (ex-Serie C1) campaign, which the Emilia–Romagna side won the Group A champion.
In 2009-10 season, he played as a emergency central back (against Frosinone in May 2010) and other positions, including right back ahead Martin Petráš in last 10 matches of the season. That season Cesena won promotion to Serie A.
Ceccarelli made his debut on the first round of 2010–11 Serie A, a 0-0 draw with previous season runner-up Roma. He lost his starting place in November, after the match slipped from the top to bottom and failed to win for over 5 matches. Yuto Nagatomo was moved from left back to right back and Maurizio Lauro took back the starting place. On 28 November he re-took the starting place but rested against Cagliari on 18 December, the match before the winter break.
