Stadio Comunale "Is Arenas" is a sports stadium in Quartu Sant'Elena, Sardinia, Italy. It is mostly used for football games and it will be the home venue of Serie A club Cagliari Calcio for the 2012â€“13 season.
The stadium is currently under renovation after Cagliari relocated out of its former home venue, Stadio Sant'Elia, in order to make it comply with Serie A league standards in time for the new season.
