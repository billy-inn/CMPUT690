Richmond Yiadom Boakye ( /bʊɑːˈtʃiː/ buuah-CHEE) (born 28 January 1993 in Agogo) is a Ghanaian professional footballer who plays for Serie B club Sassuolo in Italy (on loan from Genoa of Serie A and its Primavera U20 team) also in Italy.
Boakye started his career with Bechem United and in 2008 went to Vicenza, Italy for a tournament; he was scouted by Genoa, and remained in Italy.
He played in the Primavera U20 Youth League in the 2009–10 season.
On 3 April 2010, Boakye made his Serie A debut, against bottom club Livorno. He substituted for David Suazo in the 13th minute and scored the opening goal, but the game ended in a 1–1 draw.
On 2 May, he played in his second match, substituting for Giuseppe Sculli in the 71st minute. That match was also the debut match of Boakye's countryman, Isaac Cofie, but Genoa lost to Bari 0–3 and finished in 8th place or below, failing to qualify for the UEFA Europa League.
On 21 June 2011, Ghana youth striker Richmond Boakye-Yiadom has agreed a loan deal to join Italian Serie B side Sassuolo next season.
