Radja Nainggolan (born 4 May 1988) is a Belgian footballer who plays for Cagliari Calcio in Italy, as a midfielder.
Nainggolan was born in Antwerp to an Indonesian father of Batak ancestry — Radja (or Raja) meaning "king" in Indonesian language. His mother was Belgian, and he also had a half brother and two half sister, as well as a twin sister.
Nainggolan arrived at Piacenza Calcio in late 2005 at the age of 17, from local K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot. Still a junior, he managed to appear in two Serie B games for the club, in two separate seasons.
Nainggolan played in 38 matches in 2008–09 for the Emilia-Romagna outfit, scoring three goals for an eventual 10th-place finish. On 27 January 2010, he was loaned to Cagliari Calcio in Serie A, with the Sardinians having an option to buy the player permanently at the end of the season. He made his league debut on 7 February, playing seven minutes in a 0–3 away loss against F.C. Internazionale Milano.
On 21 June 2010, Cagliari acquired Nainggolan on a permanent basis.
Nainggolan earned his first cap for Belgium on 29 May 2009, against Chile in the Kirin Cup.
