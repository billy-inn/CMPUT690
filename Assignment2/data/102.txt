Samuel Llorca Ripoll (born 26 April 1985 in Alicante, Valencian Community), simply Samuel, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Hércules CF as a central defender.
Samuel started his senior career at Hércules CF, with its reserves. In 2005, he moved to amateur neighbours CD Alone de Guardamar, being an important unit as it eventually retained its fourth division status.
Samuel stayed in the region for the following season, as he signed with Elche CF Ilicitano, also in that category. On 9 June 2007, courtesy of manager David Vidal, he made his debut with the first team, Elche CF, starting in a 1–0 home win against CD Castellón. He consolidated his position in 2007–08, with the club also in the second level, and received abroad offers from England's Sheffield United and Fulham, which eventually died down.
