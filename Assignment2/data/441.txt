Cristian Darío Álvarez (born 13 November 1985 in General Lagos, Santa Fe) is an Argentine footballer who plays for RCD Espanyol in Spain, as a goalkeeper.
Álvarez came through the youth ranks at hometown side Rosario Central making his first team debuts in a Libertadores Cup game against Paraguayan side Cerro Porteño on 23 February 2006, a 0–2 home loss. He went on to fully establish himself as the club's first-choice, playing two seasons in the first division.
In late May 2008, Álvarez joined Spanish team RCD Espanyol, signing a five-year contract. He spent most of his spell with the Catalans restricted to cup matches, being barred in La Liga by Cameroonian Carlos Kameni: his longest run in the latter competition came during the 2009–10 season, as the starter had been selected to the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, and he played four matches, conceding as many goals in two wins, one draw and one loss.
Álvarez was promoted to first-choice for the start of the 2011–12 season by manager Mauricio Pochettino, with Kameni also still in Espanyol's roster.
