Marc-André ter Stegen (born 30 April 1992) is a German professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
In the first half of the 2010–11 Season, ter Stegen established himself as the star of Borussia Mönchengladbach's reserve team and was frequently seen on the first-team bench. Whilst he was enjoying a relatively successful season, the same could not be said for his first-team colleagues. Mönchengladbach's senior side were seemingly failing in their efforts to avoid relegation, and on February 14, 2011 then manager Michael Frontzeck was replaced by Lucien Favre, with the team rooted to the bottom of the Bundesliga having accumulated only 16 points after 22 match days.
Results soon improved, but the erratic form of first-choice goalkeeper Logan Bailly held the team back. Whilst he was able to produce match-winning performances such as the one against Werder Bremen, these were few and far between, and were frequently cancelled out by uninspiring games. The fans of Die Fohlen were quick to discredit the Belgian international, with some accusing him of putting more effort into his modelling career than his football. ter Stegen's progress for the reserve
