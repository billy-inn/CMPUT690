Ânderson Miguel da Silva (born 28 July 1983), aka Nenê, is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Cagliari Calcio in Italy, as a striker.
Born in São Paulo, Nenê began his career with modest Brazilian outfits, also having a spell at Cruzeiro Esporte Clube, then moved abroad to Portuguese League's C.D. Nacional in July 2008.
In his debut season in Portugal, he turned in stellar performances, topping the goalscoring charts with 20 goals (22 overall), notably netting in home fixtures against Sporting Clube de Portugal (1–1) and Sport Lisboa e Benfica (3–1 win), while also helping the Madeira team reach the semifinals of the Portuguese Cup and qualify for the UEFA Europa League.
In June 2009, Nenê joined Italy's Cagliari Calcio on a four-year contract for about €4.5 million, with the player reported to be earning approximately €450,000 per season.
Nenê spent his first season in the Serie A alternating between the starting XI and the substitutes bench, but still scored eight goals - second-best in the squad - as the Sardinia club narrowly avoided relegation. On 12 December 2010, he netted a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win against Calcio Catania.
