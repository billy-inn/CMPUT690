Nicolás Federico López Alonso (born 1 October 1993 in Montevideo) is a Uruguayan footballer who plays as a striker for club Roma.
Nicknamed "El Conejo", López started his football career as part of the Montevideo Wanderers, but was originally rejected after he was deemed not to be physically strong enough to play professionally. He successively joined the Nacional youth academy, where he turned into a very prolific striker and, more occasionally, left winger.
On 24 April 2011, after being promoted as part of the first team under head coach Juan Ramón Carrasco, López made his debut at the age of 17 in a league game against Central Español, promptly scoring also his first senior goal.
In August 2011, López was involved in a feud with Nacional, after his father revealed the player was in Italy in order to hold talks with a number of unspecified Serie A sides, leading his Uruguayan club and the national federation to consider potential actions to the FIFA against the player.
