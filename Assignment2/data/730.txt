Vincenzo 'Enzo' Maresca (born 10 February 1980) is an Italian footballer who plays for Málaga CF in La Liga, as a midfielder.
Born in Pontecagnano Faiano, Province of Salerno, Maresca started playing football at the age of 11 with A.C. Milan, joining Cagliari Calcio after three years.
He made his senior debut with English club West Bromwich Albion in 1998, where he played for two incomplete seasons in the Football League First Division.
In January 2000, Maresca moved back to Italy and joined Juventus FC, in a transfer worth £4.3 million, a club record sale for Albion at the time. He played in only one Serie A game until the end of the season.
For two of the following three seasons, Maresca was loaned to fellow league teams Bologna F.C. 1909 and Piacenza Calcio (co-ownershp deal in the latter case), scoring nine goals in 2002–03 but suffering team relegation. Subsequently, Juve bought the remainder 50% of his rights, for €2.6 million.
In the 2004 summer, ACF Fiorentina signed Maresca along with Fabrizio Miccoli and Giorgio Chiellini for €13 million, with Juventus holding half of the players' rights. He made his official debut on 12 September, playing 60 minutes in a 0–1 away loss
