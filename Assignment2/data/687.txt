Jeffrén Isaac Suárez Bermúdez (born 20 January 1988), simply Jeffrén, is a Spanish footballer who plays Sporting Clube de Portugal as a forward or winger.
He is known for his crossing ability and his ability to unsettle defenders with his combination of speed and skill.
Born in Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela, Jeffrén was just one year old when his family left the country for Tenerife.
FC Barcelona talent scouts spotted him and, in 2004, he was signed for its youth teams from CD Tenerife, first being coached by Guillermo Hoyos, who played him as a midfielder.
Jeffrén played three full seasons with FC Barcelona B, suffering Segunda División B relegation in 2006–07, and scoring six goals in 30 games in the following season in an immediate promotion back. On 25 October 2006, at the age of 18, he made his debut with the first team, against CF Badalona in a Copa del Rey round-of-32 match, replacing Javier Saviola in the 83rd minute of a 4–0 home win (6–1 on aggregate).
Impressed at the player's performance for the reserves, first-team manager Josep Guardiola called Jeffrén for the 2008–09 pre-season, where he played all seven matches scoring twice, including once on 30 July against ACF
