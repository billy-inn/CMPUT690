Enrique "Quique" de Lucas Martínez (born 17 August 1978) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Celta de Vigo mainly as an attacking midfielder.
Born in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Province of Barcelona, Catalonia, de Lucas emerged through the ranks of RCD Espanyol, making his first team debut on May 15, 1998, at Real Valladolid, in his sole appearance of the season, being immediately promoted to the main squad.
Subsequently, he became an important offensive element for the Catalonians, appearing in 30 La Liga matches with four goals in 1999–2000, while helping the club to the season's Copa del Rey.
After his contract expired in 2002, and after an unassuming loan spell at Paris Saint-Germain the previous year, de Lucas joined Chelsea FC, being relatively used in a sole season. His only Chelsea goal was a well executed chip in the UEFA Cup against Viking FK in a 2–1 win (5–4 loss on aggregate).
He then returned to Spain, having a huge impact at Deportivo Alavés, although most of his stint was spent in the second level. He scored six goals in 40 contests, as the Basque returned to the topflight after two years, being immediately relegated the following season.
