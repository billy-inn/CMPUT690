Juan Francisco Moreno Fuertes (born 11 September 1988 in Madrid), aka Juanfran, is a Spanish footballer who plays for Real Madrid Castilla. Mainly a winger, he can also play as a striker.
Juanfran joined local Getafe CF's youth ranks aged 17. He made his senior debuts in 2007, playing with the reserves in Tercera División. On 12 March 2008, he made his first team debut, replacing Jaime Gavilán in the last minutes of a 1–0 home win against S.L. Benfica, for the season's UEFA Cup (3–1 aggregate win); his first La Liga appearance came 11 days later, also from the bench, in a 0–1 loss at Athletic Bilbao.
After one year with Villarreal CF's B team in Segunda División B, which ended in promotion, a first-ever for the team, Juanfran returned to his hometown and signed with Real Madrid. He spent the vast majority of his first seasons with the club with Real Madrid Castilla, also in level three.
On 2 May 2010, Juanfran made his debut with Real Madrid's main squad, replacing Argentine Fernando Gago in a home league fixture against CA Osasuna, with five minutes to go: the score was then at 2–2, but the Merengues eventually won it 3–2, thanks to a Cristiano Ronaldo goal.
