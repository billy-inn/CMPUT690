Antonio Donnarumma (born 7 July 1990) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Serie B club Gubbio, on loan from Milan.
A native of Castellammare di Stabia, Donnarumma started his football career with local team Juve Stabia, before joining Milan at the age of 15. He spent five seasons in the club's youth system and he was a member of the under-16 squad who won the Campionato Nazionale Allievi in 2007, as well as a member of the under-20 side who claimed the Coppa Italia Primavera in 2010, 25 years after the team's last success in the competition — though he missed the second leg of the final through suspension.
Donnarumma was also selected five times for first-team games since 2008, but eventually he was never fielded nor named on the bench. In spite of that, Milan Youth Department Manager Filippo Galli hinted that the young goalkeeper might have been ready to join the first team permanently.
In the end, however, Donnarumma was loaned out to Serie B club Piacenza for the 2010–11 season, in order to gain some first team experience. He made his official debut for the club on 14 August 2010, in the second preliminary round of the Coppa Italia against Virtus
