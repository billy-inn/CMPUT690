Giuseppe Biava (born 8 May 1977) is an Italian footballer, who currently plays as a centre back for Serie A side Lazio.
A centre back, Biava started his career with the Leffe youth team, before moving to newly-promoted Serie D team Albinese in 1995. During his time with Albinese before the 1998 merger with the Leffe to found AlbinoLeffe, Biava achieved a promotion to Serie C2 in 1997. In 1998–99, Biava helped AlbinoLeffe to ensure promotion to Serie C1. After a one-year loan at Serie C2 side Biellese, Biava returned to AlbinoLeffe in 2001, and was part of the team that won the promotion playoffs in 2003, thus ensuring them a Serie B place.
In 2003–04, Biava marked his Serie B debut, and scored the goal which ensured the first AlbinoLeffe victory in the league, a 1–0 win to Fiorentina.
His impressive performances in the league provoked interest from ambitious Serie B club Palermo, which signed him during the January 2004 transfer window. Biava immediately gained a stable place in the regular lineup, forming a tough defensive line together with Pietro Accardi and leading the rosanero back to Serie A after over 30 years.
