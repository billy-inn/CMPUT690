Adilson Tavares Varela (born 22 October 1988 in Praia), commonly known as Cabral, is a Cape Verdean-Swiss footballer who currently plays as midfielder in the Swiss Super League for FC Basel.
Cabral came through the ranks at FC Lausanne-Sport and made his debut in 2005. He went on to play 26 games for the club before leaving for FC Basel in 2007 on a free transfer, signing a 3 year deal. He played his debut for Basel in the 5:1 away defeat on 5 August 2007 against BSC Young Boys.

His best goal was in the 2010/2011 UEFA Champions League against A.S. Roma when he dribbled around the defence and then lobed the ball over Bogdan Lobonţ to the final score of 3:1. At
