Henrique Adriano Buss (born 14 October 1986), more commonly known as Henrique, is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Palmeiras as a defender. He has played for the Brazil national team, having been capped once during early 2008.
Ajax were said to have tabled a bid for Henrique in June 2008, which was soon followed by a report saying he had agreed terms with FC Barcelona. Barcelona agreed to sign Henrique from Palmeiras for €8 million, with an extra €2 million in bonuses, on a five-year deal, and that he would be loaned out to Bayer Leverkusen. The transfer was completed a day later. Henrique made 27 league appearances in his season with Leverkusen and reached the final of the German Cup. He returned to Barcelona in June 2009, being given the number 23 shirt upon his return. On 31 August 2009, Henrique was loaned out to Racing Santander. On 15 July 2011, he returned to Brazil. On 2 June 2012 Barcelona cancelled Henrique's contract so he was released. Henrique was reunited with Palmeiras on a free transfer after a successful loan in the 2011–12 season.
On 21 March 2008, Henrique received his first call up to the Brazilian national team, after centre back Juan was cut from the squad
