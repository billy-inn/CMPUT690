Iriney Santos da Silva (born 23 April 1981 in Humaitá, Amazonas), simply Iriney, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Real Betis in Spain, as a central midfielder.
He also holds a Spanish passport, having spent more than one decade playing in the country.
Iriney made his professional debuts with Associação Desportiva São Caetano in 2000, and moved to Spain with Rayo Vallecano two years later. Eventually moving into the Madrid side's starting lineups, he did saw it drop two consecutive divisions.
In the summer of 2005, Iriney joined Celta de Vigo, being one of the Galicians most consistent players during his two-season spell in La Liga. Following the 2006–07 relegation he decided to leave the club, but was unable to find a club until the 2008 January transfer window, when he signed with UD Almería.
Subsequently, after gaining match practice, he was relatively used during his stay in Andalusia, with Almería consecutively maintaining its top division status. In late June 2009, his contract expired and he moved to neighbours Real Betis, freshly relegated to the second level.
