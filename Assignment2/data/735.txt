Oier Olazábal Paredes (born 14 September 1989 in Irun, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country), is a Spanish footballer who plays for FC Barcelona B as a goalkeeper.
Olazábal arrived in FC Barcelona's youth academy at the age of 16, from local Real Unión. He spent his first years with the reserves as backup to another youth product, Rubén.
On 2 January 2008, Oier made his debut for the main squad, in the 2–2 home draw against CD Alcoyano in the cup. More than one year after, on 17 May, he appeared for the first time in La Liga, against RCD Mallorca, as Barça were already champions, in a 1–2 away loss.
For 2009–10, after Albert Jorquera left for neighbours Girona FC, Olazábal was promoted to third-choice.
