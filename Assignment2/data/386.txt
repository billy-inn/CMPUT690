The Vicente Calderón Stadium is the home stadium of La Liga football club Atlético Madrid and is located in the Arganzuela district of Spanish capital Madrid. The stadium was originally called the Manzanares Stadium, but this was later changed to the Vicente Calderón Stadium, after the famous Atlético club president. The seats are laid out in red and white stripes, the colours of Atlético's shirts. The stadium is located in the heart of Madrid, on the banks of the Manzanares.
Vicente Calderón regularly hosts international matches of the Spanish national team. Since 2003, the Vicente Calderón stadium has been classified as a 5 Star UEFA Elite stadium, and was the first Spanish stadium to attain this classification.
On March 17, 1961, Javier Barroso bought land for the construction of a new stadium, replacing the Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid, which had begun to reduce in capacity. Thus, in the same year, work began on the new stadium.
To finance the new stadium, Atlético Madrid had to make a debt issue three years previously, in 1958, in the form of mortgage bonds that were underwritten mostly by club shareholders and members, thus contributing their savings to build the stadium.
